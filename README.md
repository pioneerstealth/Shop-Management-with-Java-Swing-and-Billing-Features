# Efficient Shop Management with Java Swing and Billing Features

## Overview

This project aims to develop an efficient shop management application using the Java Swing framework. The application offers a user-friendly interface for managing customer and product information and includes convenient billing features. It is developed using the NetBeans IDE, making it easy to navigate and modify the codebase.

## Features

The shop management application includes the following features:

1. Customer Management: Easily add, remove, and update customer information, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records.

2. Product Management: Efficiently manage products by adding, removing, and updating product details, enabling accurate inventory control.

3. Billing: Generate invoices using the iTextPDF module based on customer purchases, facilitating seamless billing processes. The application integrates with a MariaDB database, which can be hosted as a Docker instance running on the operating system.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Java Swing: Provides a robust framework for creating the user interface and enabling intuitive navigation and interaction.

- NetBeans IDE: Offers a convenient development environment for Java applications, making it easy to design the user interface and manage the project codebase.

- MariaDB: A popular open-source relational database management system that efficiently handles data management for the shop management application. It can be hosted as a Docker instance, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

- iTextPDF: A powerful Java library for creating PDF documents, utilized in the application to generate invoices for billing purposes.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the shop management application, follow these steps:

1. Install the NetBeans IDE on your machine.

2. Set up a MariaDB database either as a local installation or as a Docker instance.

3. Import the project into the NetBeans IDE.

4. Configure the database connection in the application code to connect to the MariaDB database.

5. Build and run the application from the NetBeans IDE.

## Usage

Once the shop management application is up and running, you can use the user-friendly interface to perform the following tasks:

- Manage customer information: Add, remove, and update customer details as required.

- Manage product inventory: Add, remove, and update product details to maintain accurate inventory records.

- Generate invoices: Generate invoices for customer purchases using the iTextPDF module, providing seamless billing functionality.
